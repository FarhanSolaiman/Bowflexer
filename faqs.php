	<p class="head ml-4">HOW DO I TUNE MY BOW? (OUR ALL-TIME MOST POPULAR SUBJECT)</p>
	<p class="text mx-auto">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly every tuning question is covered in the Tuning and Maintenance Guide found across the internet.</p>
	<p class="head ml-4">WHERE CAN I BUY EASTON ARROWS?</p>
	<p class="text mx-auto">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of Easton Arrows are provided in our shop.</p>
	<p class="head ml-4">WHAT IS A “FULL METAL JACKET®” ARROW?</p>
	<p class="text mx-auto">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full Metal Jacket (FMJ) technology is a patented arrow construction only from Easton. This revolutionary arrow combines the best attributes of carbon and aluminum in a heavy-duty configuration. The small diameter and thick wall carbon-fiber core with Hidden Insert Technology (HIT) provides superior penetration, durability and accuracy. The aerospace alloy aluminum jacket provides more consistent spine, straightness, and higher stored energy than all-carbon arrows. The end result is an arrow with outstanding accuracy, durability and bone-crushing penetration. In addition, when compared to all-carbon arrows, FMJ’s innovative metal jacket design delivers easy arrow removal from tough, high-density 3D targets.</p>	
	<p class="head ml-4">HOW DO I MEASURE CORRECT ARROW LENGTH?</p>
	<p class="text mx-auto">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correct arrow length is measured from the bottom, inside of the nock groove (deepest point where the string goes into the nock) to the cut end of the shaft, not including the point or point insert.</p>
	<p class="head ml-4">ARE COMPONENTS MODEL SPECIFIC?</p>
	<p class="text mx-auto">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each and every shaft that Easton produces has its own components specifically designed for that particular shaft. Selecting the correct components will be important when trying to replace damaged or misplaced components. Refer to the Easton Arrow Guides or the Easton website for complete component specifications for your particular shaft.</p>
	<p class="head ml-4">WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF THE HIT SYSTEM?</p>
	<p class="text mx-auto">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easton’s patented HIT (Hidden Insert Technology) system was originally designed to fit next generation, small-diameter (ST or Slim Tech) arrows that are built for more penetration and better durability. Due to the new, small-circumference design, standard, lipped inserts would no longer be compatible. HIT was engineered to fit up inside the arrow shaft, hidden from view. HIT gives automatic broadhead alignment because the broadhead shank aligns directly against the shaft wall for easy, no-fuss broadhead setup. Perfectly aligned broadheads mean more accuracy and tighter broadhead groups. HIT and ST (Slim Technology) combine to form the next great advancement in hunting arrows, offering more accuracy, durability & penetration than standard carbon arrows.</p>
